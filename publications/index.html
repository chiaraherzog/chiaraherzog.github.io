Here, we analysed cervical and breast DNA methylation (n=1848) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (n=1442) and demonstrate that a linear combination of methylation levels at 104 BC-associated methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) CpGs, termed the WID‚Ñ¢-qtBC index, can identify women with breast cancer in hormone-sensitive tissues (AUC=0.71 [95% CI: 0.65‚Äì0.77] in cervical samples). Women in the highest combined risk group (high polygenic risk score and WID‚Ñ¢-qtBC) had a 9.6-fold increased risk for BC [95% CI: 4.7‚Äì21] compared to the low-risk group and tended to present at more advanced stages. Importantly, the WID‚Ñ¢-qtBC is influenced by non-genetic BC risk factors, including age and body mass index, and can be modified by a preventive pharmacological intervention, indicating an interaction between genome and environment recorded at the level of the epigenome.

Persistent oncogenic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is the most common cause for cervical cancer. Here, we investigate HPV‚Äêinduced host epigenome‚Äêwide changes prior to development of cytological abnormalities. Using cervical sample methylation array data from disease‚Äêfree women with or without an oncogenic HPV infection, we develop the WID (Women‚Äôs cancer risk identification)‚ÄêHPV, a signature reflective of changes in the healthy host epigenome related to high‚Äêrisk HPV strains (AUC=0.78, 95% CI: 0.72‚Äê0.85, in non‚Äêdiseased women). Looking at HPV‚Äêassociated changes across disease development, HPV‚Äêinfected women with minor cytological alterations (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1/2, CIN1/2), but surprisingly not those with precancerous changes or invasive cervical cancer (CIN3+), show an increased WID‚ÄêHPV index, indicating the WID‚ÄêHPV may reflect a successful viral clearance response absent in progression to cancer. Further investigation revealed the WID‚ÄêHPV is positively associated with apoptosis (œÅ=0.48; p&lt;0.001) and negatively associated with epigenetic replicative age (œÅ=‚Äê0.43; p&lt;0.001). Taken together, our data suggest the WID‚ÄêHPV captures a clearance response associated with apoptosis of HPV‚Äêinfected cells. This response may be dampened or lost with increased underlying replicative age of infected cells, resulting in progression to cancer. This article is protected by copyright.

Measures to identify women at risk and to detect endometrial cancer earlier are required to reduce the morbidity triggered by the aggressive treatment required for advanced endometrial cancer. We developed the WID‚ÄêEC (Women‚Äôs cancer risk IDentification‚ÄêEndometrial Cancer) test, which is based on DNA methylation at 500 CpG sites, in a discovery set of cervical liquid‚Äêbased cytology samples from 1086 women with and without an endometrial cancer (217 cancer cases and 869 healthy controls) with a worse prognosis (grade 3 or ‚â•stage IB). We validated the WID‚ÄêEC test in an independent external validation set of 64 endometrial cancer cases and 225 controls. We further validated the test in 150 healthy women (prospective set) who provided a cervical sample as part of the routine Swedish cervical screening programme, 54 of whom developed endometrial cancer within 3 years of sample collection. The WID‚ÄêEC test identified women with endometrial cancer with a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88‚Äê0.97) in the external set and of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74‚Äê0.89) in the prospective validation set. Using an optimal cutoff, cancer cases were detected with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 90% in the external validation set, and a sensitivity and specificity of 52% and 98% respectively in the prospective validation set. The WID‚ÄêEC test can identify women with or at risk of endometrial cancer. The endometrial cancer incidence is rising, and imaging‚Äêbased screening is often not suitably accurate for endometrial cancers. Here, the authors show that a new DNA methylation signature (Women‚Äôs cancer risk IDentification‚ÄêEndometrial Cancer, or WID‚ÄêEC) can both detect the presence and predict the risk of endometrial cancer. Together with three other recently‚Äêreported methylation indices that detect breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers (WID‚ÄêBC, WID‚ÄêOC, and WID‚ÄêCIN), WID‚ÄêEC completes a list of signatures that can detect/predict all four women‚Äêspecific cancers using a single cervical sample and the same technology platform for methylation array‚Äêbased tests.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/senolysis_review.png"></div> <div id="senolysisreview" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Dietary restriction in senolysis and prevention and treatment of disease</div> <div class="author"> Sepideh Aminzadeh-Gohari,¬†Barbara Kofler,¬†and¬†<b><u>Chiara Herzog</u></b> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition</em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2022.2153355" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Aging represents a key risk factor for a plethora of diseases.

Delays in diagnosis reduce survival and necessitate more aggressive treatment. We aimed to develop and validate a simple, noninvasive, and reliable triage test for EC to reduce the number of invasive diagnostic procedures and improve patient survival. <br>METHODS: We developed a test to screen and triage women with suspected EC using 726 cervical smear samples from women with and without EC, and validated the test in 562 cervicovaginal samples using three different collection methods (cervical smear: n = 248; vaginal swab: n = 63; and self-collection: n = 251) and four different settings (case/control: n = 388; cohort of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding: n = 63; a cohort of high-risk women with Lynch syndrome: n = 25; and a nested case/control setting from a screening cohort and samples taken up to 3 years before EC diagnosis: n = 86). <br>RESULTS: We describe the Women‚Äôs cancer risk IDentification ‚Äì quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for Endometrial Cancer (WID-qEC), a three-marker test that evaluates DNA methylation in gene regions of GYPC and ZSCAN12. In cervical, self-collected, and vaginal swab samples derived from symptomatic patients, it detected EC with sensitivities of 97.2% (95% CI, 90.2 to 99.7), 90.1% (83.6 to 94.6), and 100% (63.1 to 100), respectively, and specificities of 75.8% (63.6 to 85.5), 86.7% (79.3 to 92.2), and 89.1% (77.8 to 95.9), respectively. The WID-qEC identified 90.9% (95% CI, 70.8 to 98.9) of EC cases in samples predating diagnosis up to 1 year. Test performance was similar across menopausal status, age, stage, grade, ethnicity, and histology. <br>CONCLUSION: The WID-qEC is a noninvasive reliable test for triage of women with symptoms suggestive of ECs. Because of the potential for self-collection, it could improve early diagnosis and reduce the reliance for in-person visits.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/widqcin.png"></div> <div id="widqcin" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">DNA methylation-based detection and prediction of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and invasive cervical cancer with the WID‚Ñ¢-qCIN test</div> <div class="author"> <b><u>Chiara Herzog*</u></b>,¬†Karin Sundstr√∂m*,¬†Allison Jones, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 14 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '14 more authors' ?

Cytology as triage for colposcopy referral suffers from several shortcomings. HPV testing overcomes some of these but lacks specificity in women under 30. Here, we aimed to develop and validate an automatable triage test that is highly sensitive and specific independently of age and sample heterogeneity, and predicts progression to CIN3+ in HPV+ patients. The WID‚Ñ¢-qCIN, assessing three regions in human genes DPP6, RALYL, and GSX1, was validated in both a diagnostic (case‚Äìcontrol) and predictive setting (nested case‚Äìcontrol), in a total of 761 samples. Using a predefined threshold, the sensitivity of the WID‚Ñ¢-qCIN test was 100% and 78% to detect invasive cancer and CIN3, respectively. Sensitivity to detect CIN3+ was 65% and 83% for women &lt; and ‚â• 30 years of age. The specificity was 90%. Importantly, the WID‚Ñ¢-qCIN test identified 52% of ‚â• 30-year-old women with a cytology negative (cyt‚àí) index sample who were diagnosed with CIN3 1‚Äì4 years after sample donation. We identified suitable DNAme regions in an epigenome-wide discovery using HPV+ controls and CIN3+ cases and established the WID‚Ñ¢-qCIN, a PCR-based DNAme test. The WID‚Ñ¢-qCIN test has a high sensitivity and specificity that may outperform conventional cervical triage tests and can in an objective, cheap, and scalable fashion identify most women with and at risk of (pre-)invasive cervical cancer. However, evaluation was limited to case‚Äìcontrol settings and future studies will assess performance and generalisability in a randomised controlled trial.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/widcin.png"></div> <div id="widcin" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The WID-CIN test identifies women with, and at risk of, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and invasive cervical cancer</div> <div class="author"> James E.

HPV testing is highly sensitive but there is currently no high-specificity triage method for colposcopy referral to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or above (CIN3+) in women positive for high-risk (hr) HPV subtypes. An objective, automatable test that could accurately perform triage, independently of sample heterogeneity and age, is urgently required. We analyzed DNA methylation at ¬†850,000 CpG sites across the genome in a total of 1254 cervical liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples from cases of screen-detected histologically verified CIN1-3+ (98% hrHPV-positive) and population-based control women free from any cervical disease (100% hrHPV-positive). Samples were provided by a state-of-the-art population-based cohort biobank and consisted of (i) a discovery set of 170 CIN3+ cases and 202 hrHPV-positive/cytology-negative controls; (ii) a diagnostic validation set of 87 CIN3+, 90 CIN2, 166 CIN1, and 111 hrHPV-positive/cytology-negative controls; and (iii) a predictive validation set of 428 cytology-negative samples (418 hrHPV-positive) of which 210 were diagnosed with CIN3+ in the upcoming 1‚Äì4 years and 218 remained disease-free. We developed the WID-CIN (Women‚Äôs cancer risk IDentification-Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia) test, a DNA methylation signature consisting of 5000 CpG sites. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) in the independent diagnostic validation set was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88‚Äì0.96). At 75% specificity (‚â§CIN1), the overall sensitivity to detect CIN3+ is 89.7% (83.3‚Äì96.1) in all and 92.7% (85.9‚Äì99.6) and 65.6% (49.2‚Äì82.1) in women aged ‚â•30 and &lt;30. In hrHPV-positive/cytology-negative samples in the predictive validation set, the WID-CIN detected 54.8% (48.0‚Äì61.5) cases developing 1‚Äì4 years after sample donation in all ages or 56.9% (47.6‚Äì66.2) and 53.5% (43.7‚Äì63.2) in ‚â•30 and &lt;30-year-old women, at a specificity of 75%.

A simple, operator‚Äêindependent and accurate test to correctly identify women presenting with abnormal bleeding as a consequence of endometrial or cervical cancer is urgently required. We have recently developed and validated the WID‚ÄêqEC test, which assesses DNA methylation of ZSCAN12 and GYPC via real‚Äêtime PCR, to triage women with symptoms suggestive of endometrial cancer using ThinPrep‚Äêbased liquid cytology samples. Here, we investigated whether the WID‚ÄêqEC test can additionally identify women with cervical cancer. Moreover, we evaluate the test‚Äôs applicability in a SurePath‚Äêbased hospital‚Äêcohort by comparing its ability to detect endometrial and cervical cancer to cytology. In a set of 23 cervical cancer cases and 28 matched controls the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) is 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97‚Äê1.00) with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 92.9%, respectively. Amongst the hospital‚Äêcohort (n = 330), the ROC AUC is 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98‚Äê1) with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 82.5% for the WID‚ÄêqEC test, respectively, and 33.3% and 96.9% for cytology (considering PAP IV/V as positive). Our data suggest that the WID‚ÄêqEC test detects both endometrial and cervical cancer with high accuracy. While abnormal vaginal bleeding is a presenting symptom of endometrial and cervical cancers, only a small proportion of women who present with vaginal bleeding have endometrial or cervical cancer. Currently, the tests used to triage women with abnormal bleeding, such as ultrasound or cytology, are subjective and have modest accuracy. Here, the authors demonstrate that a real‚Äêtime PCR‚Äêbased test, which assesses DNA methylation at three gene regions using a cervical or vaginal sample, is able to identify 100% of women who have cervical or endometrial cancer with a high specificity (&gt;80%), irrespective of the sample collection system.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/mife.png"></div> <div id="mife" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Antiprogestins reduce epigenetic field cancerization in breast tissue of young healthy women</div> <div class="author"> Thomas E.

Progesterone drives expansion of luminal progenitor cells, leading to the development of poor-prognostic breast cancers. However, it is not known if antagonising progesterone can prevent breast cancers in humans. We suggest that targeting progesterone signalling could be a means of reducing features which are known to promote breast cancer formation. In healthy premenopausal women with and without a BRCA mutation we studied (i) estrogen and progesterone levels in saliva over an entire menstrual cycle (n = 20); (ii) cancer-free normal breast-tissue from a control population who had no family or personal history of breast cancer and equivalently from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (n = 28); triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) biopsies and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the TNBC in the same individuals (n = 14); and biopsies of ER+ve/PR+ve stage T1‚ÄìT2 cancers and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the cancer in the same individuals (n = 31); and (iii) DNA methylation and DNA mutations in normal breast tissue (before and after treatment) from clinical trials that assessed the potential preventative effects of vitamins and antiprogestins (mifepristone and ulipristal acetate; n = 44). Daily levels of progesterone were higher throughout the menstrual cycle of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, raising the prospect of targeting progesterone signalling as a means of cancer risk reduction in this population. Furthermore, breast field cancerization DNA methylation signatures reflective of (i) the mitotic age of normal breast epithelium and (ii) the proportion of luminal progenitor cells were increased in breast cancers, indicating that luminal progenitor cells with elevated replicative age are more prone to malignant transformation. The progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone reduced both the mitotic age and the proportion of luminal progenitor cells in normal breast tissue of all control women and in 64% of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. These findings were validated by an alternate progesterone receptor antagonist, ulipristal acetate, which yielded similar results. Importantly, mifepristone reduced both the TP53 mutation frequency as well as the number of TP53 mutations in mitotic-age-responders. These data support the potential usage of antiprogestins for primary prevention of poor-prognostic breast cancers.

An epigenome-based signature capturing these components in easily accessible samples could identify women at risk. Here, we analyse the DNA methylome in 2,818 cervical, 357 and 227 matched buccal and blood samples respectively, and 42 breast tissue samples from women with and without breast cancer. Utilising cervical liquid-based cytology samples, we develop the DNA methylation-based Women‚Äôs risk IDentification for Breast Cancer index (WID-BC-index) that identifies women with breast cancer with an AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic) of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80‚Äì0.88) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76‚Äì0.86) in internal and external validation sets, respectively. CpGs at progesterone receptor binding sites hypomethylated in normal breast tissue of women with breast cancer or in BRCA mutation carriers are also hypomethylated in cervical samples of women with poor prognostic breast cancer. Our data indicate that a systemic epigenetic programming defect is highly prevalent in women who develop breast cancer. Further studies validating the WID-BC-index may enable clinical implementation for monitoring breast cancer risk. Breast cancer is most commonly diagnosed via a needle biopsy. In this study, the authors show that cervical samples from women with breast cancer have a methylation signature different to that of healthy controls.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/wid.oc.jpg"></div> <div id="widoc" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The DNA methylome of cervical cells can predict the presence of ovarian cancer</div> <div class="author"> James E.

Here, we demonstrate that a DNA methylation signature in easy-to-access M√ºllerian Duct-derived cervical cells from women with and without ovarian cancer (i.e. referred to as the Women‚Äôs risk IDentification for Ovarian Cancer index or WID-OC-index) is capable of identifying women with an ovarian cancer in the absence of tumour DNA with an AUC of 0.76 and women with an endometrial cancer with an AUC of 0.81. This and the observation that the cervical cell WID-OC-index mimics the epigenetic program of those cells at risk of becoming cancerous in BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers (i.e. mammary epithelium, fallopian tube fimbriae, prostate) further suggest that the epigenetic misprogramming of cervical cells is an indicator for cancer predisposition. This concept has the potential to advance the field of risk-stratified cancer screening and prevention. Most ovarian cancers originate from cells originally derived from M√ºllerian Duct cells. Here, the authors show that the methylation profile of M√ºllerian Duct cells isolated from cervical samples can predict whether a woman has cervical cancer.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/clocks.jpg"></div> <div id="widrea" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Susceptibility to hormone-mediated cancer is reflected by different tick rates of the epithelial and general epigenetic clock</div> <div class="author"> James E.

Whether discordant tick rates between tissue-specific and general epigenetic clocks play a role in health and disease has not yet been explored. Here we analyze 1941 cervical cytology samples, which contain a mixture of hormone-sensitive cervical epithelial cells and immune cells, and develop the WID general clock (Women‚Äôs IDentification of risk), an epigenetic clock that is shared by epithelial and immune cells and optimized for cervical samples. We then develop the WID epithelial clock and WID immune clock, which define epithelial- and immune-specific clocks, respectively. We find that the WID-relative-epithelial-age (WID-REA), defined as the difference between the epithelial and general clocks, is significantly reduced in cervical samples from pre-menopausal women with breast cancer (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.28-5.72). We find the same effect in normal breast tissue samples from pre-menopausal women at high risk of breast cancer and show that potential risk reducing anti-progesterone drugs can reverse this. In post-menopausal women, this directionality is reversed. Hormone replacement therapy consistently leads to a significantly lower WID-REA in cancer-free women, but not in post-menopausal women with breast or ovarian cancer. Our findings imply that there are multiple epigenetic clocks, many of which are tissue-specific, and that the differential tick rate between these clocks may be an informative surrogate measure of disease risk.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/mg.gif"></div> <div id="rnaseq" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">RNA-seq analysis and compound screening highlight multiple signalling pathways regulating secondary cell death after acute CNS injury in vivo</div> <div class="author"> <b><u>Chiara Herzog</u></b>,¬†David Greenald,¬†Juan Larraz, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

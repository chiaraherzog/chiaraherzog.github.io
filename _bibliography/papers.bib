	abstract = {{The search for biomarkers that quantify biological aging (particularly ‘omic’-based biomarkers) has intensified in recent years. Such biomarkers could predict aging-related outcomes and could serve as surrogate endpoints for the evaluation of interventions promoting healthy aging and longevity. However, no consensus exists on how biomarkers of aging should be validated before their translation to the clinic. Here, we review current efforts to evaluate the predictive validity of omic biomarkers of aging in population studies, discuss challenges in comparability and generalizability and provide recommendations to facilitate future validation of biomarkers of aging. Finally, we discuss how systematic validation can accelerate clinical translation of biomarkers of aging and their use in gerotherapeutic clinical trials. Robust validation of biomarkers of aging will be critical to their clinical translation; here, authors review the key challenges and propose recommendations to overcome them.}},

	abstract = {{Analysis of cell‐free DNA methylation (cfDNAme), alone or combined with CA125, could help to detect ovarian cancers earlier and may reduce mortality. We assessed cfDNAme in regions of ZNF154, C2CD4D and WNT6 via targeted bisulfite sequencing in diagnostic and early detection (preceding diagnosis) settings. Diagnostic samples were obtained via prospective blood collection in cell‐free DNA tubes in a convenience series of patients with a pelvic mass. Early detection samples were matched case‐control samples derived from the UK Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UKFOCSS). In the diagnostic set (ncases = 27, ncontrols = 41), the specificity of cfDNAme was 97.6\% (95\% CI: 87.1\%‐99.9\%). High‐risk cancers were detected with a sensitivity of 80\% (56.3\%‐94.3\%). Combination of cfDNAme and CA125 resulted in a sensitivity of 94.4\% (72.7\%‐99.9\%) for high‐risk cancers. Despite technical issues in the early detection set (ncases = 29, ncontrols = 29), the specificity of cfDNAme was 100\% (88.1\%‐100.0\%). We detected 27.3\% (6.0\%‐61.0\%) of high‐risk cases with relatively lower genomic DNA (gDNA) contamination. The sensitivity rose to 33.3\% (7.5\%‐70.1\%) in samples taken <1 year before diagnosis. We detected ovarian cancer in several patients up to 1 year before diagnosis despite technical limitations associated with archival samples (UKFOCSS). Combined cfDNAme and CA125 assessment may improve ovarian cancer screening in high‐risk populations, but future large‐scale prospective studies will be required to validate current findings. Our findings indicate that combining cell‐free DNA methylation analysis in three genetic regions with CA125 may improve the sensitivity of ovarian cancer detection in high‐risk women. Women with a positive score in either diagnostic modality, particularly double‐positive individuals, could be referred for a PET‐CT scan to rule out a positive result due to a different cancer, and could undergo surgery even in the absence of a visible ovarian tumour on imaging given the high specificity of cfDNAme.}},

Women in the highest combined risk group (high polygenic risk score and WID™-qtBC) had a 9.6-fold increased risk for BC [95% CI: 4.7–21] compared to the low-risk group and tended to present at more advanced stages. Importantly, the WID™-qtBC is influenced by non-genetic BC risk factors, including age and body mass index, and can be modified by a preventive pharmacological intervention, indicating an interaction between genome and environment recorded at the level of the epigenome. Our findings indicate that methylation levels at mQTLs in relevant surrogate tissues could enable integration of heritable and non-heritable factors for improved disease risk stratification.},

Persistent oncogenic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is the most common cause for cervical cancer. Here, we investigate HPV‐induced host epigenome‐wide changes prior to development of cytological abnormalities. Using cervical sample methylation array data from disease‐free women with or without an oncogenic HPV infection, we develop the WID (Women's cancer risk identification)‐HPV, a signature reflective of changes in the healthy host epigenome related to high‐risk HPV strains (AUC=0.78, 95\% CI: 0.72‐0.85, in non‐diseased women). Looking at HPV‐associated changes across disease development, HPV‐infected women with minor cytological alterations (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1/2, CIN1/2), but surprisingly not those with precancerous changes or invasive cervical cancer (CIN3+), show an increased WID‐HPV index, indicating the WID‐HPV may reflect a successful viral clearance response absent in progression to cancer. Further investigation revealed the WID‐HPV is positively associated with apoptosis (ρ=0.48; p<0.001) and negatively associated with epigenetic replicative age (ρ=‐0.43; p<0.001). Taken together, our data suggest the WID‐HPV captures a clearance response associated with apoptosis of HPV‐infected cells. This response may be dampened or lost with increased underlying replicative age of infected cells, resulting in progression to cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.}},

Measures to identify women at risk and to detect endometrial cancer earlier are required to reduce the morbidity triggered by the aggressive treatment required for advanced endometrial cancer. We developed the WID‐EC (Women's cancer risk IDentification‐Endometrial Cancer) test, which is based on DNA methylation at 500 CpG sites, in a discovery set of cervical liquid‐based cytology samples from 1086 women with and without an endometrial cancer (217 cancer cases and 869 healthy controls) with a worse prognosis (grade 3 or ≥stage IB). We validated the WID‐EC test in an independent external validation set of 64 endometrial cancer cases and 225 controls. We further validated the test in 150 healthy women (prospective set) who provided a cervical sample as part of the routine Swedish cervical screening programme, 54 of whom developed endometrial cancer within 3 years of sample collection. The WID‐EC test identified women with endometrial cancer with a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.88‐0.97) in the external set and of 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.74‐0.89) in the prospective validation set. Using an optimal cutoff, cancer cases were detected with a sensitivity of 86\% and a specificity of 90\% in the external validation set, and a sensitivity and specificity of 52\% and 98\% respectively in the prospective validation set. The WID‐EC test can identify women with or at risk of endometrial cancer. The endometrial cancer incidence is rising, and imaging‐based screening is often not suitably accurate for endometrial cancers. Here, the authors show that a new DNA methylation signature (Women's cancer risk IDentification‐Endometrial Cancer, or WID‐EC) can both detect the presence and predict the risk of endometrial cancer. Together with three other recently‐reported methylation indices that detect breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers (WID‐BC, WID‐OC, and WID‐CIN), WID‐EC completes a list of signatures that can detect/predict all four women‐specific cancers using a single cervical sample and the same technology platform for methylation array‐based tests.}},

We aimed to develop and validate a simple, noninvasive, and reliable triage test for EC to reduce the number of invasive diagnostic procedures and improve patient survival. <br>METHODS: We developed a test to screen and triage women with suspected EC using 726 cervical smear samples from women with and without EC, and validated the test in 562 cervicovaginal samples using three different collection methods (cervical smear: n = 248; vaginal swab: n = 63; and self-collection: n = 251) and four different settings (case/control: n = 388; cohort of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding: n = 63; a cohort of high-risk women with Lynch syndrome: n = 25; and a nested case/control setting from a screening cohort and samples taken up to 3 years before EC diagnosis: n = 86). <br>RESULTS: We describe the Women's cancer risk IDentification – quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for Endometrial Cancer (WID-qEC), a three-marker test that evaluates DNA methylation in gene regions of GYPC and ZSCAN12. In cervical, self-collected, and vaginal swab samples derived from symptomatic patients, it detected EC with sensitivities of 97.2\% (95\% CI, 90.2 to 99.7), 90.1\% (83.6 to 94.6), and 100\% (63.1 to 100), respectively, and specificities of 75.8\% (63.6 to 85.5), 86.7\% (79.3 to 92.2), and 89.1\% (77.8 to 95.9), respectively. The WID-qEC identified 90.9\% (95\% CI, 70.8 to 98.9) of EC cases in samples predating diagnosis up to 1 year. Test performance was similar across menopausal status, age, stage, grade, ethnicity, and histology. <br>CONCLUSION: The WID-qEC is a noninvasive reliable test for triage of women with symptoms suggestive of ECs. Because of the potential for self-collection, it could improve early diagnosis and reduce the reliance for in-person visits.}},

We identified suitable DNAme regions in an epigenome-wide discovery using HPV+ controls and CIN3+ cases and established the WID™-qCIN, a PCR-based DNAme test.

HPV testing is highly sensitive but there is currently no high-specificity triage method for colposcopy referral to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or above (CIN3+) in women positive for high-risk (hr) HPV subtypes. An objective, automatable test that could accurately perform triage, independently of sample heterogeneity and age, is urgently required. We analyzed DNA methylation at ~850,000 CpG sites across the genome in a total of 1254 cervical liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples from cases of screen-detected histologically verified CIN1-3+ (98\% hrHPV-positive) and population-based control women free from any cervical disease (100\% hrHPV-positive). Samples were provided by a state-of-the-art population-based cohort biobank and consisted of (i) a discovery set of 170 CIN3+ cases and 202 hrHPV-positive/cytology-negative controls; (ii) a diagnostic validation set of 87 CIN3+, 90 CIN2, 166 CIN1, and 111 hrHPV-positive/cytology-negative controls; and (iii) a predictive validation set of 428 cytology-negative samples (418 hrHPV-positive) of which 210 were diagnosed with CIN3+ in the upcoming 1–4 years and 218 remained disease-free. We developed the WID-CIN (Women’s cancer risk IDentification-Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia) test, a DNA methylation signature consisting of 5000 CpG sites. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) in the independent diagnostic validation set was 0.92 (95\% CI 0.88–0.96). At 75\% specificity (≤CIN1), the overall sensitivity to detect CIN3+ is 89.7\% (83.3–96.1) in all and 92.7\% (85.9–99.6) and 65.6\% (49.2–82.1) in women aged ≥30 and <30. In hrHPV-positive/cytology-negative samples in the predictive validation set, the WID-CIN detected 54.8\% (48.0–61.5) cases developing 1–4 years after sample donation in all ages or 56.9\% (47.6–66.2) and 53.5\% (43.7–63.2) in ≥30 and <30-year-old women, at a specificity of 75\%. The WID-CIN test identifies the vast majority of hrHPV-positive women with current CIN3+ lesions.

A simple, operator‐independent and accurate test to correctly identify women presenting with abnormal bleeding as a consequence of endometrial or cervical cancer is urgently required. We have recently developed and validated the WID‐qEC test, which assesses DNA methylation of ZSCAN12 and GYPC via real‐time PCR, to triage women with symptoms suggestive of endometrial cancer using ThinPrep‐based liquid cytology samples. Here, we investigated whether the WID‐qEC test can additionally identify women with cervical cancer. Moreover, we evaluate the test's applicability in a SurePath‐based hospital‐cohort by comparing its ability to detect endometrial and cervical cancer to cytology. In a set of 23 cervical cancer cases and 28 matched controls the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) is 0.99 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97‐1.00) with a sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 92.9\%, respectively. Amongst the hospital‐cohort (n = 330), the ROC AUC is 0.99 (95\% CI: 0.98‐1) with a sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 82.5\% for the WID‐qEC test, respectively, and 33.3\% and 96.9\% for cytology (considering PAP IV/V as positive). Our data suggest that the WID‐qEC test detects both endometrial and cervical cancer with high accuracy. While abnormal vaginal bleeding is a presenting symptom of endometrial and cervical cancers, only a small proportion of women who present with vaginal bleeding have endometrial or cervical cancer. Currently, the tests used to triage women with abnormal bleeding, such as ultrasound or cytology, are subjective and have modest accuracy. Here, the authors demonstrate that a real‐time PCR‐based test, which assesses DNA methylation at three gene regions using a cervical or vaginal sample, is able to identify 100\% of women who have cervical or endometrial cancer with a high specificity (>80\%), irrespective of the sample collection system.}},

	abstract = {{Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in premenopausal women. Progesterone drives expansion of luminal progenitor cells, leading to the development of poor-prognostic breast cancers. However, it is not known if antagonising progesterone can prevent breast cancers in humans. We suggest that targeting progesterone signalling could be a means of reducing features which are known to promote breast cancer formation. In healthy premenopausal women with and without a BRCA mutation we studied (i) estrogen and progesterone levels in saliva over an entire menstrual cycle (n = 20); (ii) cancer-free normal breast-tissue from a control population who had no family or personal history of breast cancer and equivalently from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (n = 28); triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) biopsies and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the TNBC in the same individuals (n = 14); and biopsies of ER+ve/PR+ve stage T1--T2 cancers and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the cancer in the same individuals (n = 31); and (iii) DNA methylation and DNA mutations in normal breast tissue (before and after treatment) from clinical trials that assessed the potential preventative effects of vitamins and antiprogestins (mifepristone and ulipristal acetate; n = 44). Daily levels of progesterone were higher throughout the menstrual cycle of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, raising the prospect of targeting progesterone signalling as a means of cancer risk reduction in this population. Furthermore, breast field cancerization DNA methylation signatures reflective of (i) the mitotic age of normal breast epithelium and (ii) the proportion of luminal progenitor cells were increased in breast cancers, indicating that luminal progenitor cells with elevated replicative age are more prone to malignant transformation. The progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone reduced both the mitotic age and the proportion of luminal progenitor cells in normal breast tissue of all control women and in 64\% of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. These findings were validated by an alternate progesterone receptor antagonist, ulipristal acetate, which yielded similar results. Importantly, mifepristone reduced both the TP53 mutation frequency as well as the number of TP53 mutations in mitotic-age-responders. These data support the potential usage of antiprogestins for primary prevention of poor-prognostic breast cancers.

	abstract = {{Genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to breast cancer development. An epigenome-based signature capturing these components in easily accessible samples could identify women at risk. Here, we analyse the DNA methylome in 2,818 cervical, 357 and 227 matched buccal and blood samples respectively, and 42 breast tissue samples from women with and without breast cancer. Utilising cervical liquid-based cytology samples, we develop the DNA methylation-based Women's risk IDentification for Breast Cancer index (WID-BC-index) that identifies women with breast cancer with an AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic) of 0.84 (95\% CI: 0.80--0.88) and 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.86) in internal and external validation sets, respectively. CpGs at progesterone receptor binding sites hypomethylated in normal breast tissue of women with breast cancer or in BRCA mutation carriers are also hypomethylated in cervical samples of women with poor prognostic breast cancer. Our data indicate that a systemic epigenetic programming defect is highly prevalent in women who develop breast cancer. Further studies validating the WID-BC-index may enable clinical implementation for monitoring breast cancer risk. Breast cancer is most commonly diagnosed via a needle biopsy. In this study, the authors show that cervical samples from women with breast cancer have a methylation signature different to that of healthy controls.}},

	abstract = {{The vast majority of epithelial ovarian cancer arises from tissues that are embryologically derived from the M{\"u}llerian Duct. Here, we demonstrate that a DNA methylation signature in easy-to-access M{\"u}llerian Duct-derived cervical cells from women with and without ovarian cancer (i.e. referred to as the Women's risk IDentification for Ovarian Cancer index or WID-OC-index) is capable of identifying women with an ovarian cancer in the absence of tumour DNA with an AUC of 0.76 and women with an endometrial cancer with an AUC of 0.81. This and the observation that the cervical cell WID-OC-index mimics the epigenetic program of those cells at risk of becoming cancerous in BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers (i.e. mammary epithelium, fallopian tube fimbriae, prostate) further suggest that the epigenetic misprogramming of cervical cells is an indicator for cancer predisposition. This concept has the potential to advance the field of risk-stratified cancer screening and prevention. Most ovarian cancers originate from cells originally derived from M{\"u}llerian Duct cells. Here, the authors show that the methylation profile of M{\"u}llerian Duct cells isolated from cervical samples can predict whether a woman has cervical cancer.}},

	abstract = {{A variety of epigenetic clocks utilizing DNA methylation changes have been developed; these clocks are either tissue-independent or designed to predict chronological age based on blood or saliva samples. Whether discordant tick rates between tissue-specific and general epigenetic clocks play a role in health and disease has not yet been explored. Here we analyze 1941 cervical cytology samples, which contain a mixture of hormone-sensitive cervical epithelial cells and immune cells, and develop the WID general clock (Women's IDentification of risk), an epigenetic clock that is shared by epithelial and immune cells and optimized for cervical samples. We then develop the WID epithelial clock and WID immune clock, which define epithelial- and immune-specific clocks, respectively. We find that the WID-relative-epithelial-age (WID-REA), defined as the difference between the epithelial and general clocks, is significantly reduced in cervical samples from pre-menopausal women with breast cancer (OR 2.7, 95\% CI 1.28-5.72). We find the same effect in normal breast tissue samples from pre-menopausal women at high risk of breast cancer and show that potential risk reducing anti-progesterone drugs can reverse this. In post-menopausal women, this directionality is reversed. Hormone replacement therapy consistently leads to a significantly lower WID-REA in cancer-free women, but not in post-menopausal women with breast or ovarian cancer. Our findings imply that there are multiple epigenetic clocks, many of which are tissue-specific, and that the differential tick rate between these clocks may be an informative surrogate measure of disease risk.}},

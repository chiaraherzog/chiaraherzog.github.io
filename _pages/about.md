I'm a translational scientist at the intersection of computational biology and clinical resarch at the European Translational Oncology Prevention and Screening Institute (<a href="http://www.eutops.info" target = "_blank">EUTOPS</a>; Universität Innsbruck) and a honorary research fellow at the Institute for Women's Health (University College London).

My work focuses on the association of `epigenetics (DNA methylation)` with cancer risk and ageing. I'm passionate about harnessing epigenetics and other biomarkers for risk prediction, early detection, and monitoring of `personalized preventive strategies`. Currently, I co-lead the clinical <a href="/projects/1_project/">TirolGESUND</a> study (ClinicalTrials.gov <a href="https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05678426">NCT05678426</a>) alongside <a href="https://eutops.institute/institute/leadership" target="_blank">Prof. Martin Widschwendter</a> (UIBK, UCL, Karolinska). This study aims to assess longitudinal changes in the epigenome and other biomarkers of ageing and disease in response to smoking cessation and intermittent fasting.

As part of the <a href="https://www.agingconsortium.org/">Biomarkers of Aging Consortium</a> Roadmap Group, I actively promote standardisation for research into biomarkers of aging, and I have a special interest in employing more robust methods to <b>advance molecular biomarkers into promising clinical tools for personalized disease prevention</b>.

My work is driven by a commitment to improving healthcare through prevention and enhancing our understanding of age-related disease. I firmly believe that innovative research and collaborative efforts can pave the way for a more <b>personalized and inclusive approach to health</b>.

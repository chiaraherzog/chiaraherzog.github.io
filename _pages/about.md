I'm am a King's Prize Fellow establishing my own research programme at the Department for Twin Research at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/herzog-group" target="_blank">King's College London</a>, with additional affiliations at the European Translational Oncology Prevention and Screening Institute (<a href="http://www.eutops.info" target = "_blank">EUTOPS</a>; Universit√§t Innsbruck) and the Institute for Women's Health (University College London; honorary research fellow).

My research sits at the interface of computational and experimental biology and clinical research, focusing how `epigenetic regulation` - particularly DNA methylation - shapes ageing and age-related disease. I'm passionate about uncovering the `molecular basis of ageing`, developing robust biomarkers to monitor individual biological ageing, and exploring how targeted interventions can modulate these processes. Together with <a href="https://eutops.institute/institute/leadership" target="_blank">Prof. Martin Widschwendter</a> (UIBK, UCL, Karolinska), I co-led the <a href="/projects/1_project/">TirolGESUND</a> study (ClinicalTrials.gov <a href="https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05678426">NCT05678426</a>, a longitudinal, multi-omic study profiling the effects of intermittent fasting and smoking cessation across multiple tissues, and I continue to intgrate human multi-omic datasets with experimental approaches to dissect causal mechanisms underlying ageing. 

As member of the <a href="https://www.agingconsortium.org/">Biomarkers of Aging Consortium</a> Executive Committee, I actively promote standardisation for research into biomarkers of aging, and I have a special interest in employing more robust methods to <b>advance molecular biomarkers into promising clinical tools for personalized disease prevention</b>.

Ultimately, my work is driven by the vision to move beyond risk prediction to mechanistic understanding - identifying which ageing processes drive disease and how we can intervene to maintain health across lifespan.

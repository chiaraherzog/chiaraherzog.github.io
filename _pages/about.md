<h2>about</h2>

I'm a translational scientist at the intersection of bioinformatics and clinical resarch at the European Translational Oncology Prevention and Screening Institute (<a href="http://www.eutops.info" target = "_blank">EUTOPS</a>; Universit√§t Innsbruck) and a honorary research fellow at the Institute for Women's Health (University College London).

My work focuses on DNA methylation and its association with cancer risk and ageing. I am currently co-leading the clinical <a href="/projects/1_project/">TirolGESUND</a> study with <a href="https://eutops.institute/institute/leadership" target="_blank">Prof. Martin Widschwendter</a> (UIBK, UCL, Karolinska) assessing longitudinal changes in the epigenome and other ageing biomarkers in response to smoking cessation and intermittent fasting.

The Universit√§t Innsbruck is part of the Human Exposome Assessment Platform (<a href="https://heap-exposome.eu/work-packages/" target="_blank">HEAP</a>) Horizon 2020 programme. Leading on work package 8, we are assessing the impact of various environmental factors such as age, smoking, and natural drift, on the epigenome (DNA methylation patterns).

This work is ongoing with manuscripts under review and in preparation.

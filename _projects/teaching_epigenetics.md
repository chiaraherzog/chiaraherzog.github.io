## Course overview

Epigenetics and cancer is an intensive full-time module (lecture series, seminar, and practical exercise) over 4 weeks with the educational objective of providing a better understanding of the carcinogenesis and **translational (cancer) research**. 2023 I included a special focus on determinants of health and the importance of **diversity in medicine**.

## Course contents

### Lecture series

* Impact of aging, external factors, and epigenetics on carcinogenesis
* Types of epigenetic modifications
* Laboratory and computational methods to study epigenetic modifications
* Clinical applications of epigenetics for cancer diagnosis and prevention
* Biobanking and clinical study design
* Social determinants of health and importance of diversity in medicine

### Practical exercise: from the bedside to translational research

Students follow a sample from the clinic to the biobank to the analysis and perform hands-on translational research.

* Part I: Clinic visit
* Part II: Ethics and biobanking: identification of a new research question, preparation of a study plan and submission of an ethics proposal; 'ethics committee session'
* Part III: Laboratory processing and analysis of samples and data
* Part IV: Science communication: preparing a lay abstract and science outreach for the research question

### Seminar series

Discussion of recent studies involving epigenetics or other biomarkers for translational purposes.

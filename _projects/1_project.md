I'm co-leading the TirolGESUND (general exercise - smoking undone - nutrition & diet) study with <a href="https://eutops.institute/institute/leadership" target="_blank">Prof. Martin Widschwendter</a>, having prepared the study protocol, ethics application, and analysis plan. In brief, we will recruit 180 women and help them to stop smoking (n=60) or conduct intermittent fasting (n=120) for 6 months with an adjuvant exercise programme. Before, throughout, and after the intervention, we will assess age- and disease-related biomarkers, focussing on the epigenome.

The study team I am coordinating consists of over 50 collaborators from all health- and research institutions in Tyrol, including clinical doctors, dieticians, addiction therapists, psychologists, and other researchers.

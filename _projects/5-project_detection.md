A strong focus of my work is to utilise novel diagnostic methods, such as DNA methylation analysis in cervical surrogate samples, to improve women's health and reduce the burden of breast, ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer. I have written a summary of our rationale and approach for the Nature Portfolio Cancer Community, [Harnessing the epigenetic footprint to detect breast and ovarian cancer using cervical samples](https://cancercommunity.nature.com/posts/harnessing-the-epigenetic-footprint-to-detect-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-using-cervical-samples).

Aspects of this work - both for prediction and detection - are published in:

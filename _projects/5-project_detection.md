A strong focus of my work is to utilise epigenetics (DNA methylation) as a molecular tool for early cancer detection and risk prediction. We utilise non-invasive collection of samples (e.g., cervical, buccal, or blood samples) to improve women's health and reduce the burden of breast, ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer. I have written a summary of our rationale and approach for the Nature Portfolio Cancer Community, [Harnessing the epigenetic footprint to detect breast and ovarian cancer using cervical samples](https://cancercommunity.nature.com/posts/harnessing-the-epigenetic-footprint-to-detect-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-using-cervical-samples).

We are continuously investigating how these biomarkers can be employed for <b>dynamic monitoring of cancer risk over time</b>, as well as <b>assessing the efficacy of preventive strategies</b>. Ultimately, these insights could lead to improved adaptive/personalized screening and prevention programs. Our vision is to use biomarkers in a way analogous to blood pressure monitoring for preventing cardiovascular disease - identifying individuals at increased risk, suggesting preventive strategies, monitoring their effectiveness, and making necessary adjustments if needed.

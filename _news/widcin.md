A new paper I am a coauthor on appears today in [Genome Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-022-01116-9).

The research is featured in the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/19/scientists-develop-more-accurate-predictive-test-for-cervical-cancer) and the [Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11328475/Four-one-cancer-test-taking-swab-cervix.html), amongst other news outlets.

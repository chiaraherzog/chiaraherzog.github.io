My joint-first author paper is out in Genome Biology today:

[Susceptibility to hormone-mediated cancer is reflected by different tick rates of the epithelial and general epigenetic clock](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02603-3). Barrett, Herzog, Kim, et al. 2022 Genome Biology.

We've identified a novel epigenetic clock that outperforms commonly used clocks by Horvath and Hannum in terms of accuracy for chronological age prediction. Additionally we investigated discordant tick rates between general and epithelial-specific age signatures in association with disease risk.

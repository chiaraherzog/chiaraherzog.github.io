I had the honour of attending the GRC Biology of Aging Conference in Castelldefels, Spain, 2023, and presenting work on the <a href="https://www.agingconsortium.org/">Biomarkers of Aging Consortium</a> and my own work on the <a href="/projects/1_project/">TirolGESUND Study / LIFESTYLE Atlas</a>. I was thrilled to hear about inspiring science and meet fantastic people. The cherry on top was a drawing of my presentation by the amazing <a href="https://www.alexcagan.com">Alex Cagan</a>. Thanks to everyone who made the meeting special!

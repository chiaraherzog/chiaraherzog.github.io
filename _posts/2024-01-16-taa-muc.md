I will be presenting our work as part of the [European Translational Oncology Prevention and Screening Institute](https://www.eutops.institute/), and [Biomarkers of Aging Consortium](https://www.agingconsortium.org/), later this year at **[Turn Around Aging](https://turnaroundaging.com/)** - the first healthy longevity conference in German-speaking countries.

Very pleased to have been invited to this exciting initiative so close to home, and looking forward to talk all about longevity, biomarkers and how to validate them, personalised prevention, and ongoing and future studies! :sparkles:

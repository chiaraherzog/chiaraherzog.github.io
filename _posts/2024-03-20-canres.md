Today, our manuscript on the impact of smoking and vaping was published in *Cancer Research*. Dissecting the impact of smoking on the epigenome across diverse cell types, including directly exposed (cheek) and not directly exposed (blood or cervicovaginal samples), we find that cells alter in their responses and modulated pathways due to smoking. 

Changes in buccal epithelial cells of smokers that are directly exposed to the tobacco are also observed in smokeless tobacco users and in e-cigarette users with a very limited smoking history. Importantly, the same alterations are also observed in cancer tissue or biopsies that later progressed to lung cancer. Our findings suggest further investigation into the long-term health implications of snuff tobacco and e-cigarettes as smoking cessation tools. Pending further validation, buccal samples may also have the potential to monitor individual disease risk.

I’m happy to share that I’ve joined the Executive Committee of the [Biomarkers of Aging Consortium](https://www.agingconsortium.org/). Hugely excited to continue to work with an amazing team and community on establishing Biomarkers of Aging as reliable tools for longevity interventions, and excited to see what we can achieve together in the next year.

I had the pleasure of attending the European Human Exposome Network (EHEN) meeting in Leuven this week - it was great seeing collaborators/friends from the Human Exposome Assessment Platform (HEAP), and making new ones from other projects.

I'd also like to thank the organisers for the opportunity to present our work on smoking and epigenetics in the plenary session ðŸ§¬, and for the rooftop conference dinner.

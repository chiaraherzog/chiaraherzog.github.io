🚨 Three new first-author papers. One clear message: Epigenetics can transform how we detect and prevent breast cancer - non-invasively.

I’m proud to share a new trio of studies, published today in Nature Communications and Communications Medicine. Together, they trace a path from risk prediction to biological insight to prevention through the lens of epigenomic biomarkers, measurable from non-invasive samples like buccal swabs:

🧬🔬 <b>1. Predicting breast cancer risk from buccal swabs (Nature Communications)</b>

We show that DNA methylation in buccal samples reflects breast tissue biology and can predict cancer risk.

⏳🧠 <b>2. Functionally-enriched ageing signatures applied across diverse tissues (Communications Medicine)</b>

This study challenges how we think about epigenetic clocks, showing that discordant ageing between tissues may be linked to cancer susceptibility.


💊🐭 <b>3. Preventing breast cancer with mifepristone, tracked via the epigenome (Communications Medicine)</b>

We demonstrate that mifepristone prevents breast cancer in mice, and that its impact can be monitored in breast and non-invasive samples alike.

🧭 Together, these studies suggest a future where disease risk is detected early and we can guide personalised prevention through epigenomic signatures in non-invasive samples.

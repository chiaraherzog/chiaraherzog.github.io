Our first manuscript of the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium, for which I had the pleasure to join the drafting team and am a co-first author on, appears today in [Cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.08.003). We established a new framework and consensus for biomarkers of aging for the evaluation of longevity interventions.

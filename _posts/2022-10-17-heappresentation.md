I had the honour of presenting my work on our intervention study at the HEAP Symposium, `Frontiers in Human Exposome Research`, in Graz. 

A recording of my talk is now available on Youtube.

We also got to visit the Biobank of the Medical University of Graz. A very informative and wholesome meeting that made me fall in love with the City of Graz.

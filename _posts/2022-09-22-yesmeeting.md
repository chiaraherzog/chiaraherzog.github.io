I had the honour to be invited to present our recent work on DNA methylation-based detection and risk prediction for four women's cancers from cervical samples as one of the plenary keynote speakers at the Young European Scientist Meeting in Porto. I also participated in a 'meet the scientist' session, and it was great fun meeting so many motivated students!

The meeting was extremely well organised and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I received the Annual Research Award in the Category "Basic Science" from the ÖGMBT - Austrian Association of Molecular Life Sciences and Biotechnology as part of their Annual Life Sciences Meeting in Graz, Austria.

I'm extremely pleased that our work on the [epigenetic effects of smoking and e-cigarettes, published earlier this year in AACR Journals Cancer Research](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/doi/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-2957/741851/Cigarette-smoking-and-e-cigarette-use-induce) was recognised with this prestigious award. I extend my gratitude to the jury for the opportunity to present this work during the Rising Stars Lectures.

I'm hugely honoured to receive the **Professor Anthony Mellows Medal** for my research into epigenetics and aging üèÖ

Awarded during the 2025 [King's College London Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine Winter](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/index) Graduation Ceremony by Prof. Ajay Shah and Lord Simon Stevens, this prestigious medal not only recognises my previous work but also supports my independent research through a fellowship to [establish my research programme](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/herzog-group) within the Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology at King‚Äôs College London.  

My sincere thanks to the Professor Anthony Mellows Foundation and Mrs. Mellows for this honour that is transformative for my research career, as well as to my mentors past and present, colleagues, and collaborators whose insights continue to inspire and shape my work.

I'm excited to keep pushing the boundaries of epigenetics research at King‚Äôs College London.

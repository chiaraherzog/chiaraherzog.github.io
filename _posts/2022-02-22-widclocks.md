Epigenetic clocks are exciting biomarkers of aging but few studies have to date investigated tissue-specific DNA methylation changes in age and how their discordance is associated with disease risk.

We've identified a novel epigenetic clock, the WID-clocks, that outperforms commonly used clocks by Horvath and Hannum in terms of accuracy for chronological age prediction. We investigated discordant tick rates between general and epithelial-specific age signatures and found that they are associated with hormone-mediated cancers. Monitoring tick rates of diverse clocks could help to monitor cancer risk.
